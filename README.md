===========

this is opinion on how JSX should be implemented inspired by:
 1. [crank-js](https://crank.js.org/)
 2. and hate to [react](https://reactjs.org/)

supports 3 types of elements:
 1. static - regular elements
 2. active - elements which return AsyncIterator (e.g. `function*`)
 3. future - elements which return promise (e.g. `async function`)

TODO
====

 * write docs
 * write tests
 * structure project properly
 * and â¬œ of course
